Models.ipynb contains Simple Neural Network, KNN, Random Forests, and Softmax, and Linear Regression. Each chunk of code contains instructions on how to run each individually. Comments in the file separate the code for each model.

HMM.ipynb contains the HMM with comments on the first chunk of code on how to run it and see the results. 

RNN.py contains the simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU models. Type `python RNN.py` in the Terminal to run this code.
